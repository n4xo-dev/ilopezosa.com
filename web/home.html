<p class="m-4">Hi! I am Ignacio Lopezosa Serrano, commonly known as Nacho. And this is my webpage. Pretty isn't it? Well... I am a BackEnd Engineer, so it is what it is.</p>
<p class="m-4">Here you can learn a little <a class="text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-500 hover:underline" href="#about" hx-get="/about" hx-target="#content">about</a> me. You can take a look at the <a class="text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-500 hover:underline" href="#projects" hx-get="/projects" hx-target="#content">projects</a> I have worked on (or at least the ones I am proud enough to brag about). And you can <a class="text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-500 hover:underline" href="#contact" hx-get="/contact" hx-target="#content">contact</a> me if there's anything you want to tell me. I try to respond as fast as possible.</p>
<p class="m-4">For those that are curious. This page was built using only <a href="https://htmx.org/" class="text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-500 hover:underline">HTMX</a>, <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" class="text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-500 hover:underline">TailwindCSS</a>, and <a href="https://go.dev/" class="text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-500 hover:underline">Go</a> with <a href="https://gofiber.io/" class="text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-500 hover:underline">Fiber</a>. A pretty minimal stack that is more than enough to build simple yet interactive and very performant web sites.</p>
